              <p><strong> The establishing of football club VIA</strong></p>
      
             <p>After the WW1 group of inteligent and well known people from the city has decided to establish a football team in the city because back in this time there were only few team in the entire country. For the people that wanted to play football or to practise any kind of sport they had to travel above 100km in order to do it and 100km back in 1920 was a big distance.</p> 
      
             <p>In the begining the club consisted only of a football team. The team was consistent and it fastly became popular. Shortly after the establishment, the main people in the club started to consider expanding of the club and including various additional sports. The vast majority were agree and soon the VIA club actually became a club where people could practive many different sports and compete on highest level.</p>
      
             <p><strong>Choosing the club`s name</strong></p>
      
             <p>The question about the name had brought a lot of discussions and debates. Firstly, many ideas and foreignar names had been proposed, like " Atlantic", "United" etc. After few hours of arguing about the name, finaly they decided to unite upon a name which could bring and glory to the club. "VIA" which originates from the "Victory is an art</p>
      
             <p><strong>First matches</strong></p>
      
             <p class="p">During these times neither in Horsens nor anywhere in Denmark was a football league. The clubs were arranging the games between them on principle agreement. The VIA club had consisted only from young players during that time and neither of the players had known what it means to be a professional player. It had been a challenging to find an opponent especially when the players had to travel a lot of kilometers for the game.

                  <p>The team nowadays is not famuos with its football quality nor with its honours, but it is famuos with its fans and its big history. Even though the club is not among the best clubs in the country it is safe to assume that it is amongst the most respected ones. Every children knows about VIA and every football fan knows the story about how the club was created and through what challenges it had gone through. The coach Bob is in the club for many years now and year after year he is showing his love and addiction to the club.VIA mainly rely on young players and always will. </p>
